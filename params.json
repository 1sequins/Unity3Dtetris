Our goals in this experiment is to compare how brain activities react when users are in a normal mode vs in a panic mode. In this game, we give users 3 mode of game play Dynamic,Dynamic Manual and Constant \r\n\r\nFor Dynamic Mode - Game Speed increases when users clear a line \r\nFr Dynamic Manual - Game Speed increases when users clear a line , however users can control the speed of the game.  For Constant - Game Speed do not change when users clear the line, \r\n\r\nTo play the game demo a Unity Web player can be played here http://bit.ly/11pYNpJ\r\n\r\n_For those who do not have unity web player please download it here http://unity3d.com/webplayer/_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Developer Story Background \r\n\r\nThis Tetris game is developed in 10 days, we are going to share the stories on how we build the game in 10 days. Originally, the game is an old experiment game software that was developed in 2011, however the earlier research student completed his master program and could not continue the experiment and the Game was picked up again in 2013 by another Student who would like to use the game for his experiment and thus began the story of rebuilding the game.  \r\n\r\nAfter looking at the old game code, and tried to run the run it unity, realized that the skin is missing and could not locate he old skin file as the game lies dormant for 2 years. Thus the search to find a collaborator to support the game development, We found Umair Ejaz (@habupain) who is very interested in supporting our development progress . and after chatting, we decided that the best way to build the game is to rebuild the game from scratch as the previous game , thus the story begins on how we build the Tetris Game in about 10 days. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Developer Story  \r\n\r\nOriginally, the game is developed using Java Script using 3D,however in order to improve performance on multiple platform for future development including the low memory mobile phone app and to improve our lab code literacy, we decided to rewrite the whole logic from Javascript to C#. Thus began the whole process of development of the game . \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Game is developed using Scrum methods  and using a simple task to do list app called asana, we manage to organize the tasks collaboratively through different country and timezone. Its a 10 day straight coding , testing, debugging and iterating and more testing.  The game takes into consideration from alot of the aspect from from performance and memory management to design language. In addition, we conduct constant scrumming to discuss about current progress and plan our short term tasks. \r\n\r\nIn the future more stories to follow  ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation \r\nThis page will also serve as a documentation page too, We will be writing on the programming code explanation and instruction on how people can rebuild and tweak the game themselves by  Unity3D. \r\nAs this is just a Under construction pages , we are continueing to build the pages  to check our on progress presentation powerpoint slide  at http://slid.es/williamwidjaja/unity3dtetris. The documentation will continues and \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThe game is originally developed by Sergio Nunes in 2011 for an earlier experiment. The game is then rewritten by Umair Ejaz(@habupain) in 2013 under the game direction the direction of (William Widjaja) @clauxz who is the Research Experiment Investigator. The game is developed under Scrum Methodology and takes approximately 10 days to complete \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
